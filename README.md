# EarthQuake_Prediction_Project
Earthquake Prediction System (1995-2023) 🌍🔍
This project is part of my internship at Pregrade, where I explored the application of machine learning in predicting earthquake magnitudes based on historical data.

🚀 Project Overview
In this project, I built a Machine Learning model to predict earthquake magnitudes using historical earthquake data from 1995 to 2023.
The goal is to provide a basic predictive system that can help understand seismic patterns and trends.

📊 Dataset

I have also provided the dataset used for this project in this repository: earthquake_1995-2023.csv

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Selection & Training

Performance Evaluation

Visualization of results

💡 Challenges Faced
During the development, I faced various challenges related to:

Data preprocessing and handling missing values

Feature selection

Model tuning and overfitting

I overcame these issues by leveraging resources like YouTube tutorials, ChatGPT, and online ML communities.

📝 Future Improvements
